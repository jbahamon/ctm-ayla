
Ayla by SilentProtagonist 
=========================

Ayla is a three-button character made for MUGEN 1.0.
This is not a final version.

What's missing:

- More palettes
- Special intros/winposes, maybe.


Ayla's Moveset
==============

Throws
--------------

**Boulder Toss**: F/B + [a+b/b+c/a+c] (Standing).

A standard throw. The direction you press determines the
direction your opponent will be thrown.


**Cat Attack**: D, DB, B + a/b/c (Standing). Requires 500 Power.

A special throw where Ayla jumps at the opponent,
scratching and biting him/her if it connects.
This attack only hits in the falling part of the jump.
This attack can be cancelled into Drill Kick (see below).


Specials
--------------

**Rock Throw**: D, DF, F + a/b/c (Standing).

A standard projectile that travels in an arc.
The speed and range of the rock depend on the button pressed.

**Backflip Kick**: F, D, DF + a/b/c (Standing).

Ayla does a rising kick and a diagonal kick after it.
The speed and angle of the attack depend on the button pressed.
You can cancel the first part of this special into its second
part by pressing a/b/c.

**Drill Kick**: a/b/c (while executing Cat Attack).

Ayla throws herself horizontally at the opponent while spinning.


**Tail Whirl**: D, DB, B + a/b/c (Air).

Ayla does a Tatsumaki Senpuu Kyaku-styled series of kicks. 
The a version moves horizontally; the b version, diagonally up, 
and the c version rises vertically.


Supers
------

**Tail Spin**: D, DB, B, D, DB, B + a/b/c (Standing). Requires 1000 Power.

Ayla spins and creates two twisters that damage the opponent.
You can press F or B ackwards during the spinning to slowly
move and rack up more damage. Don't let your opponents escape!
	
**Triple Kick**: D, DF, F, D, DF, F, a/b/c (Standing). Requires 1000 Power.

Ayla jumps at the opponent, kicking him/her/it up to three times.
If the first kick misses or is blocked, the move fails, so
try to use this as a combo finisher.

**Gatling Kick**: D, B, D, F + a/b/c (Standing) Requires 1000 Power. 

Ayla jumps forwards, making a spinning kick. If it connects, 
the enemy will be trapped in a vortex of debris. This is a throw 
move, so don't try it against enemies immune to those.

Special Mode
------------

**Berserker**: a + c (Standing). Requires 3000 Power.

Ayla fills with rage: you can see she's lost control! You'll automatically walk
towards your opponent.  As long as you're in this mode, almost all your moves will 
chain. Your attacks will be quicker and you can cancel them into each other. 
Your Power will automatically decrease: when you run out of Power, the mode ends.
Go for a big flashy combo!

Final Move
----------

**Instant Dino Murder / Shun Kyoryuu Satsu**: D, B, D, F + a/b/c (Standing, must have Berserker activated). Uses all of your Power.

Ayla advances toward the opponent. If it grabs him/her, everything will 
go dark as he/she gets punished. The reference in this one is pretty obvious. 
Try ending a round with this move for a special win pose!
