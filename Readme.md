Ayla is a three-button character (a+b+c keys) made for MUGEN 1.0.
This is not a final version but it should be playable.

What's missing:

- Specific character interactions (intros, winposes, double techs, maybe)

## Moveset

Ayla is meant to be sort of a rushdown character. She walks and 
runs faster than other characters; her jumps are faster, too. 
She does not work well at long distances, though, as her only 
projectile has very low range.


### Special Moves

- **Cat Attack**: `F, DF, D, DB, B, a/b/c` (Ground)

A special throw where Ayla jumps at the opponent, scratching 
and biting them if it connects.

- **Drill Kick**: `a/b/c` (during Cat Attack's jump)

Ayla transitions into a spinning kick.

- **Rock Throw**: `D, DF, F, a/b/c` (Ground)

A projectile that travels in a very small arc.
The speed and range of the rock depend on the button pressed.

- **Backflip Kick**: `F, D, DF, a/b/c` (Ground)

Ayla performs a rising kick and a diagonal kick after it.
The speed and angle of the attack depend on the button pressed.

- **Tail Whirl**: `D, DB, B, a/b/c` (Air)

Ayla spins while kicking. The `a` version moves horizontally; 
the `b` version, diagonally up, and the `c` version rises vertically.


### Super Moves

- **Tail Spin**: `D, DB, B, D, DB, B, a/b/c` (Ground)

Requires 1000 Power. Ayla spins and creates two twisters that damage the 
opponent. Pressing Left or Right will make Ayla and the twisters move 
horizontally.
	
- **Triple Kick**: `D, DF, F, D, DF, F, a/b/c` (Ground/Air)

Requires 1000 Power. Ayla jumps at the opponent, kicking them up to three times.
If the first kick misses or is blocked, the move fails.

- **Gatling Kick**: `D, B, D, F, a/b/c` (Ground)

Requires 1000 Power. Ayla jumps forwards, making a spinning kick. If it 
connects, the enemy will be trapped in a vortex of debris. Qualifies as a throw.

### Special Mode

- **Berserker**: `a + c` (Ground)

Requires 3000 Power. Ayla will automatically walk towards the opponent: while in 
this state, most of her attacks will be quicker and can be cancelled into each 
other. Ayla's Power while decrease continuously while in this state.

### Final Move

- **Instant Dino Murder / Shun Kyoryuu Satsu**: `D, B, D, F, a/b/c` (Ground 
while Berserker is active)

Spends all remaining Power. Ayla advances toward the opponent for a super throw.
Will result in a special winpose if used as a round finisher.

## 12p Mode

Ayla's 12p mode is based on Street Figher's Akuma/Gouki.

### 12p Special Moves

- **Gou Hadouken**: `D, DF, F, a/b/c` (Ground)

Akuma throws a fireball that travels horizontally. The button used determines 
the projectile's speed.

- **Zankuu Hadouken**: `D, DF, F, a/b/c` (Air)

Akuma fires two projectiles diagonally towards the ground. The button used 
determines the projectiles' speed.

- **Gou Shouryuuken**: `F, D, DF, a/b/c` (Ground)

Akuma performs a rising uppercut. The button used determines the distance 
traveled.

- **Tatsumaki Zankuu Kyaku**: `D, DB, B, a/b/c` (Ground)

Akuma spins while kicking, advancing horizontally. The button used determines 
the distance traveled.

- **Kuchuu Tatsumaki Zankuu Kyaku**: `D, DB, B, a/b/c` (Air)

Same as the previous attack, but in the air.

- **Ashura Zenkuu**: `F, D, DF, a+b/b+c` / `B, D, DB, a+b/b+c` (Ground)

Akuma becomes intangible and moves across the screen. The `F, D, DF` versions 
move forward, while the `B, D, DB` versions move backwards. The `a+b` versions 
travel less distance than the `b+c` versions.


### 12p Super Moves

- **Messatsu Gou Hadou**: `D, DF, F, D, DF, F, a/b/c` (Ground)

Akuma fires a stronger version of the Gou Hadouken. Hits multiple times.

- **Tenma Gou Zankuu**: `D, DF, F, D, DF, F, a/b/c` (Air)

Same as the previous attack, but it's fired diagonally towards the ground.

- **Messatsu Gou Rasen**: `D, DB, B, D, DB, B, a/b/c` (Ground)

Akuma performs a series of spinning kicks while rising in the air.

- **Messatsu Gou Senpuu**: `D, DB, B, D, DB, B, a/b/c` (Air)

Same as the previous attack, but in the air.

- **Messatsu Gou Shouryuu**: `D, B, D, F, a/b/c` (Ground)

Akuma performs a series of three consecutive uppercuts, the last of them rising
into the air.

Additionally, Akuma has access to **Berserker** and **Shun Kyoryuu Satsu**.
